The flag is name of Man was close the place and the birth date example TCP1P{Abdul Risna Ardana, 14 July 1669}


## Solution:

### Challenge Overview:

We were provided with five images of an unidentified nightclub and a text file containing a link to a Facebook account: Stacy Putri. The goal was to identify the nightclub and retrieve the flag.

### Step 1: Investigating the Facebook Profile

I started by examining the Facebook account linked in the challenge. Most of the posts were photos and check-ins related to a nightclub, but no obvious clues like names, locations, or events were available at first glance.

### Step 2: Watermarks in the Images

Upon reviewing the provided images, I noticed that all of them had a watermark reading "indonesiaclubbing.com." I decided to investigate this by visiting the Indonesiaclubbing website. Unfortunately, browsing through the site didnâ€™t yield any useful information that directly helped identify the nightclub.

### Step 3: Reverse Image Search

Running out of leads, I decided to perform a reverse image search on one of the nightclub images using Yandex Image Search. This proved to be the key step, as it led me to an article discussing the closure of a nightclub.

### Step 4: Wikipedia Research

The article mentioned a specific politician involved in the closure of the nightclub. I then searched for this politician on Wikipedia and found relevant information about the nightclub's history and eventual shutdown. Through this Wikipedia entry, I was able to find the name of the nightclub and, subsequently, the flag.

**Flag:** `TCP1P{Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, 29 June 1966}`
